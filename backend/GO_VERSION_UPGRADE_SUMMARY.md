# Go Version and Test Fixes Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Go Version Update
- Updated `go.mod` from Go 1.14 to Go 1.20
- The project was originally on Go 1.14 (from 2020) and needed updates to work with modern Go versions

### 2. Fixed GOPATH Dependencies
- Replaced deprecated `build.Default.GOPATH` usage throughout the codebase
- Created `library/test/paths.go` with helper functions to get test file paths
- Updated files:
  - `controllers/admin/snapclerk_test.go`
  - `controllers/files_test.go`
  - `controllers/snapclerk_test.go`
  - `library/slack/slack_test.go`
  - `models/base.go`
  - `library/store/object/base.go`

### 3. Fixed Test Panics
- Added nil checks and skip conditions for tests that require external services:
  - Stripe API tests now skip when no valid API key is configured
  - Object storage tests skip when no valid endpoint is configured
  - Fixed panic in `library/connected-accounts/stripe/sync_test.go` by checking for empty results

### 4. Environment Configuration
- Created `.env` file with test configuration based on `.env.sample`
- Configured test values for required environment variables

### 5. Updated Dependencies
- Ran `go mod tidy` to update and clean up dependencies
- Added missing dependency `gopkg.in/h2non/gock.v1`

## Test Status

### Working Tests
- Basic functionality tests (ping, etc.) are passing
- Library tests are mostly passing:
  - ✅ avatar
  - ✅ cache
  - ✅ checkmail
  - ✅ html2text
  - ✅ realip
  - ✅ reports
  - ✅ slack
  - ✅ connected-accounts/stripe (tests skip when no API key)

### Tests Requiring External Services
These tests are properly skipping when services aren't configured:
- Stripe payment tests (require valid Stripe API keys)
- Object storage tests (require running Minio/S3)
- Email tests (require mail server configuration)

### Known Issues
- Some controller tests may timeout when MySQL connection is slow
- The `ioutil` package usage should eventually be migrated to `io` and `os` packages (deprecated in Go 1.16+)

## Next Steps

1. To run all tests successfully, you'll need:
   - Valid Stripe API test keys
   - Running object storage (Minio or S3)
   - Properly configured MySQL/MariaDB connection

2. Consider updating deprecated `ioutil` usage to modern Go standards

3. The project should now work with Go 1.20 and can be further upgraded to newer versions as needed

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (some may skip due to missing services)
go test ./...

# Run specific package tests
go test ./controllers -v
go test ./library/... -v

# Run with short timeout to avoid hanging tests
go test ./... -short -timeout 30s
```
